# Web UI - SQL Server Connections Manager

Simple web interface to visually manage the `connections.json` file for MCP SQL Server. Works with any MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, etc.).

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **100% Client-side (Frontend only)**: No server, no build, no dependencies
- ✅ **Visual editing** of connections.json file
- ✅ **Add, edit, duplicate and delete** connections easily
- ✅ **Auto-load** connections.json if found in root directory
- ✅ **Drag & drop** connections between groups
- ✅ **Smart connection group selector** with existing groups
- ✅ **Automatic grouping** by `connectionGroup`
- ✅ **Real-time form validation**
- ✅ **Modern design** with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **Completely optional**: The MCP works without needing to use the UI

## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1: Open directly
1. Navigate to the folder: `C:\mcp-sqlserver\`
2. Double-click `web/connections.html`
3. It will open in your default browser

### Option 2: From browser
1. Open your browser
2. Drag the `web/connections.html` file to the browser window
3. Or use the path: `file:///C:/mcp-sqlserver/connections.html`

### Option 3: Auto-load (Recommended)
1. Place `web/connections.html` in the same directory as `connections.json`
2. Open `web/connections.html` in your browser
3. The file will be loaded automatically if found!

## 📋 Recommended Workflow

### To create/modify connections:

1. **Open the web UI**:
   - Double-click `web/connections.html`
   - If `connections.json` is in the same folder, it will load automatically
   - Otherwise, click "Load connections.json" and select your file

2. **Edit connections**:
   - Add new ones with "New Connection" button
   - Edit existing ones with the pencil icon
   - Duplicate connections with the copy icon (adds "-copy" suffix)
   - Delete with the trash icon
   - Drag & drop cards between groups to move them

3. **Download modified file**:
   - Click "Download connections.json"
   - File will be downloaded to your Downloads folder

4. **Replace original file**:
   - Copy the downloaded file
   - Replace the original in `C:\mcp-sqlserver\connections.json`

5. **Reload in your AI agent**:
   - Open your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
   - Execute: "Reload SQL Server connections"
   - Done! Connections are updated

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Security
- ⚠️ File contains passwords in plain text
- ✅ Only runs locally on your machine
- ✅ Doesn't send data to any server
- ✅ Doesn't require internet connection (except for Tailwind CDN)

### Limitations
- ❌ Doesn't test connections (only edits the file)
- ❌ Doesn't connect to MCP directly
- ❌ Requires manual file replacement
- ❌ No change history (make backups manually)

### Advantages
- ✅ No installation, no dependencies
- ✅ Works offline (with cached Tailwind)
- ✅ Cross-platform (any browser)
- ✅ Completely optional (MCP works without this)
- ✅ Auto-loads file if in same directory
- ✅ Drag & drop for easy organization
- ✅ Smart group management

## 🎨 Interface

### Main View
- List of connections grouped by group
- Cards with key information for each connection
- Action buttons (edit, duplicate, delete)
- **Drag cards** between groups to reorganize

### Edit Modal
- Complete form with all fields
- Real-time validation
- Show/hide password button
- **Smart group selector** with autocomplete
- Cancel or save changes

### Notifications

**Temporary notifications** (3 seconds, top-right):
- Success, error, or info messages
- Slide out animation

**Persistent notifications** (bottom-right, closeable):
- 🟢 **Green**: Auto-save enabled - changes saved automatically
- 🟠 **Orange**: Auto-save NOT enabled - remember to download manually
- Can be dismissed with X button

**Auto-save indicator** (header, 2 seconds):
- Green "Auto-saved" badge appears after each save
- Only visible when auto-save is active

## 💡 Tips

### Using Auto-save (Recommended)
1. Open `web/connections.html` in Chrome or Edge (86+)
2. Click "Load connections.json"
3. Grant read/write permission when prompted
4. ✅ See green notification: "Auto-save enabled!"
5. Make changes - they save automatically!
6. No need to download manually

### Without Auto-save (Fallback)
1. Open in any browser
2. Click "Load connections.json"
3. ⚠️ See orange warning about manual save
4. Make your changes
5. Click "Download connections.json"
6. Replace the original file

### Make Backup
Before making important changes:
```bash
# Backup copy
copy C:\mcp-sqlserver\connections.json C:\mcp-sqlserver\connections.backup.json
```

### Reload in Your AI Agent
After making changes:
```
"Reload SQL Server connections"
```

Or restart your AI agent completely (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT app, etc.).

### Organizing with Drag & Drop
1. Load your connections
2. Drag any connection card to another group section
3. Drop it there
4. Connection automatically moves to new group
5. Download to save changes

### Managing Groups Efficiently
When creating/editing a connection:
1. Click on "Connection Group" field
2. See dropdown with existing groups
3. Select one to avoid typos
4. Or type a new name to create a new group

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error loading file
- **Cause**: Invalid JSON format
- **Solution**: Validate JSON at jsonlint.com

### Can't download
- **Cause**: No connections loaded
- **Solution**: Load a file or add at least one connection

### Changes don't reflect in AI agent
- **Cause**: File not replaced or not reloaded
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify you replaced the original file
  2. Execute "Reload connections" in your AI agent
  3. Or restart your AI agent completely

### Duplicate name
- **Cause**: A connection with that name already exists
- **Solution**: Use a different name or delete existing one

### Auto-load doesn't work
- **Cause**: CORS restrictions with `file://` protocol
- **Solution**: Use "Load connections.json" button (recommended) or serve via http server

### Auto-save not available
- **Cause**: Browser doesn't support File System Access API (need Chrome 86+/Edge 86+)
- **Solution**: Use fallback mode - make changes and download manually

### Changes not saved
- **Cause**: Auto-save not enabled (orange warning visible)
- **Solution**: Click "Download connections.json" after making changes

### Drag & drop doesn't work
- **Cause**: Browser doesn't support HTML5 drag & drop (very rare)
- **Solution**: Edit connection and change group manually

## 🔄 Complete Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Open Web UI
file:///C:/mcp-sqlserver/connections.html

# 2. File auto-loads (if in same directory)
# or click "Load connections.json"

# 3. In Web UI
- Drag connections between groups to reorganize
- Click "New Connection"
- Select existing group from dropdown or type new one
- Fill form
- Click "Save"
- Click "Download connections.json"

# 4. Replace file
- Copy downloaded from Downloads
- Paste in C:\mcp-sqlserver\ (overwrite)

# 5. In your AI agent (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
"Reload SQL Server connections"

# 6. Verify
"List all available connections"
```

## 📝 Notes
